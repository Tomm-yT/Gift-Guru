# Gift Guru
Gift Guru is an Android app I made that allows a user to browse a diverse selection of products to discover gift ideas from an open source API. The user can create multiple profiles to represent specific individuals that they need gift ideas for, and they can also browse gift ideas based on gender filters or category filters. The user can also save items to a profile-specific list were they can keep track of gift ideas that they like for that particular person.
